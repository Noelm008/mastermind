# mastermind
This is a game I devloped during my time at university. 

Mastermind is a two-player logic game played with pegs. 
The setter chooses four pegs from among the following colours: blue, green, purple, orange, yellow, and pink. 
Repeats are allowed. The aim of the game is for the guesser to guess the four pegs that the setter chose. 
The guesser does not guess blindly; rather, the setter marks each move made by the guesser to indicate how close the move is to the answer. 
Two colours of pegs are used for this purpose: a white peg means that a peg is the correct colour in the correct place, while a red peg means that a peg is the correct colour but in the wrong place.
There is no order to the white and red pegs, so the guesser cannot tell which pegs in the move they correspond to.
If the guesser gets the correct answer in eight moves or less then they win, otherwise the setter wins.

To play the game: compile using XCode. Add the project and then select viewController.swift build and run.
